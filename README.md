# Project Euler

Simply my solutions to Project Euler problems. For anyone looking at this, go easy on me regarding style. Generally I write these purely for function, especially the smaller solutions.

Putting my progress on Euler on an indefinite hold. Would like to work on some non-mathy stuff for a bit.
